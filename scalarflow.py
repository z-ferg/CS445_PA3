ScalarFlow: A Python Automatic Differentiation Library
######################################################

ScalarFlow is a  automatic differentiation library that borrows heavily from
the TensorFlow 1.0 API.  The emphasis is on simplicity, not performance.


============================================
Building and Running Computation Graphs
============================================

The ScalarFlow library makes it possible to build and execute computation
graphs involving scalar quantities.  For example::

    import scalarflow as sf

    with sf.Graph() as g:
        a = sf.Constant(7.0)
        b = sf.Constant(3.0)
        sum = sf.Add(a, b)

        result = g.run(sum)
        print(result) # Prints 10.0

Notice that in the example above, the nodes are added to the graph
``g``, even though it is not  provided as an explicit argument when
constructing nodes in the computation graph.  The scalarflow library
maintains a default computation graph that can be set using the ``with``
keyword as above.

It is also possible to use the default computation computation graph outside
of any context.  For example::

    a = sf.Constant(7.0)
    b = sf.Constant(3.0)
    sum = sf.Add(a, b)

    result = sf.get_current_graph.run(sum)
    print(result) # Prints 10.0

============================================
Node names
============================================

All nodes in the computation graph must have unique names.  If the ``name``
argument is not provided a default name will be selected based on the node
type::

    x = sf.Constant(3.0, name='input')
    squared = sf.Pow(x, 2.0)

    print(x.name)       # Prints "input"
    print(squared.name) # Prints "Pow_0"

============================================
Variables and Placeholders
============================================

In addiction to Constants, scalarflow includes two scalar-type Nodes:
Variables and Placeholders.

============================================
Variables
============================================

Variables behave like constants, but their values may be set directly using
the ``assign`` method::

    with sf.Graph() as g:
        x = sf.Variable(4.0)
        sqrt = sf.Pow(x, .5)
        print(g.run(sqrt)) # Prints 2.0

        x.assign(25.0)
        print(g.run(sqrt)) # Prints 5.0

Variables are useful as trainable parameters in machine learning applications.

============================================
Placeholders
============================================

Placeholders must be assigned a value when ``run`` is called on the graph::

    with sf.Graph() as g:
        x = sf.Constant(4.0)
        y = sf.Placeholder(name='y')
        sum = sf.Add(x, y)

        print(g.run(sum, feed_dict={'y': 5.0})) # Prints 9.0
        print(g.run(sum, feed_dict={'y': 10.0})) # Prints 14.0

Here, ``feed_dict`` is a dictionary that maps from placeholder node names to the
value that should be used in the requested computation.  Placeholder nodes
are useful for representing inputs and outputs in machine learning training
algorithms.

============================================
Node values
============================================

The ``run`` method of the graph will only execute the subset of nodes that are
ancestors of the requested output.  As a side effect, all of the values of
those nodes are cached and are available through the ``value`` attribute::

    with sf.Graph() as g:
        a = sf.Constant(7.0, name='a')
        b = sf.Constant(3.0, name='b')
        sum = sf.Add(a, b)
        sum_sqrd = sf.Pow(sum, 2.0)
        sum_to_fourth = sf.Pow(sum_sqrd, 2.0)

        g.run(sum_sqrd)

        print(sum.value) # prints 10.0, sum was computed!
        print(sum_to_fourth.value) # Something terrible happens, never computed.

============================================
Node derivatives
============================================

If the ``compute_derivatives`` argument is True, then ``run`` perform both a
forward and backward pass.  After the backward pass completes, partial
derivatives will be available through the ``derivative`` attribute of each
node that is involved in the computation::

    with sf.Graph() as g:
        x = sf.Constant(4.0)
        y = sf.Pow(x, 2.0)  # y = x^2

        print(g.run(y)) # prints 16.0
        print(x.derivative) # prints dy/dx = 2x = 8.0

    Computation Graph

    A computation graph is a directed acyclic graph that represents a numerical
    computation performed on scalar-valued inputs. This class supports
    forward computations as well as reverse-mode automatic differentiation.

    The Graph class also acts as a Python context manager, supporting the
    ``with`` keyword.  For example::

        with sf.Graph() as g:
            a = sf.Constant(1.0)
            b = sf.Constant(2.0)
